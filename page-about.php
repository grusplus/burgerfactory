<h1 style="margin-bottom:120px;margin-top:60px;">About Me, A to Z</h1>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">a.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>A</strong>ngus. <br><br>That's my name.</p>
</div>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">b.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>B</strong>urger. <br><br>I wasn't named after a burger but I've been called Angus Burger. Also the theme I created for the last version of this site was called Burger Factory.</p>
</div>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">c.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>C</strong>ount Your Money. <br><br>Sound financial advice, and an app to help you keep your countings nice and tidy.</p>
</div>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">d.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>D</strong>o... <br><br>... I really have to go through the whole alphabet? This seemed like a great idea when I started but now I'm not so sure.</p>
</div>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">e.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>E</strong>nreprenuer'ing. <br><br>I've started and sold a number of companies. I really love creating things, and the whole companies thing is really just the result of that. I don't think of myself as an E-word.</p>
</div>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">f.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>F</strong>ree. <br><br>Is there a good way to make software free? Maybe just for those who can't afford it. Grapefruit is a one-time up-front cost. Count Your Money is an optional paid upgrade for extra features. Neither option is ideal. </p>
</div>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">g.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>G</strong>rapefruit. <br><br>A customizable, privacy-first Mental Health app for journalling, tracking your moods, and whatever else you can think of doing with it. I've used the system I built into Grapefruit for over 10 years now to keep myself on the level and it's been an invaluable tool.</p>

</div>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">i.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>I</strong>... <br><br>...am tired of writing this list already but the thing about creating stuff is that if you don't push through when you lose steam then you'll never get anything done.</p>
</div>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">j.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>J</strong>ust. <br><br>A word I tend to abuse/overuse in my first draft of anything. It's just so easy throw in anywhere.</p>
</div>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">k.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>K</strong>etchup. <br><br>What I wish there was an emoji of so I could use it as the subject title or calendar invite whenever I haven't spoken to someone in a while.</p>
</div>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">l.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>L</strong>uftangus. <br><br>A (terrible) attempt at a travel blog, well over 10 years ago, when I thought travel was 'fun' and 'exciting' and the answer to everything. After 3 years I came to the conclusion that travel is rarely about the places you go. It's about the people you visit, or share your travels with, that make or break an experience.</p>
</div>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">m.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>M</strong>anagement. <br><br>I think people management is a really difficult skill, and a highly under-rated one when it comes to general job satisfaction. The first time I managed people I was absolutely terrible at it. A lot of hard lessons learned, and it's opened my eyes to a whole new world.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">p.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>P</strong>rogramming. <br><br>I've been writing code in one form or another since the mid-90s. But I've always spread my time amoung all the skills required to make software, so have never really considered myself that. Labels are useful I admit, but this one just doesn't fit.</p>
</div>

    <p class="primary-text"><strong>U</strong>nsplash. <br><br>My hands are in some early photos on Unsplash, which got used everywhere. If you've used the Internet, you've seen my hands. I was one of the founders of Unsplash, but I can't take too much credit for the incredible accomplishments there!</p>
</div>

<div class="numeral-item-container">
    <div class="numeral">v.</div>
    <p class="primary-text"><strong>V</strong>ideo Games. <br><br>A creative medium I've always wanted to dedicate some time to. The variety of skills required to make a full game (art, music, writing, code, etc) is really interesting.</p>
