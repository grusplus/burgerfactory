== Description ==

This is a minimal theme designed to put emphasis on words, not imagery. Titles and excerpts are king
around here.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Notes ==

For best results, particularly on mobile, keep the sidebar limited to a small, simple menu. There is a widget
area after a post you can use for other things generally kept in the sidebar, like signup forms and category lists.
