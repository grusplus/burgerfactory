                        <p>Grapefruit is a privacy-first app for tracking your moods, keeping a journal, and managing your mental health. Unlike other apps which track your every move, Grapefruit has no login, no tracking scripts, and no server somewhere holding on to all of your data for all of eternity. It‚Äôs as private as your device is. So you never have to worry about your most private data being hacked, or using your intimate thoughts to sell you something.</p>

                            With <em class="app-name">Grapefruit</em>, you can do your daily reflection through writing, or
                            selecting a numerical rating,
                            or by any number of custom options you can configure just for you.
                            You'll see real benefits just from taking this time each day to gain perspective. But you'll get
                            even more
                            from the results that Grapefruit will generate for you. Find surprising patterns in your behavior,
                            and understand
                            yourself better than you ever have.

                            One of the best things you can do for your mental health is keep a journal.
                            They help you understand your thoughts, reduce stress, and many other benefits.
                            So Grapefruit is centered around that. You'll see instant
                            benefits from just journaling alone, but to get the most out of it, you can go deeper.

                            Do you know how often you have a good day? That‚Äôs one of the many things Grapefruit will show you.
                            Why? Because it‚Äôs so much easier to weather the storms when you know exactly when the sun is
                            coming. Now, how about days of the week? Or most common emotions? When you rate your days and track a few
                            things, the results can be really impactful.
